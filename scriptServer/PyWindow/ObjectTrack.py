# This script demonstrates how to track a moving object.
#
# Each time it is executed, it marks the active view
# and object. It also adds a track to the animation
# that moves the camera with the center of the bounds
# of that object.
#
# To use, setup the view like you want the camera to
# look, run this script and then run the animation.
#
# To disable tracking, select the server object in the
# pipeline browser and rerun this script.
